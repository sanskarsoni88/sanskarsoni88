### Hi there 

I'm **Sanskar Soni**, an Integrated Engineering graduate from the University of British Columbia. I specialize in Computer and Electrical engineering. I love to build innovative products designed to solve problems in various domains. This is why I have a wide range of interests and technical skills, belonging to fields such as:

    1. Microcontrollers and Embedded systems
    2. Robotics
    3. Natural Language Processing
    4. Computer vision
    5. Control systems

## My Projects:
1. [MineSweeper](https://github.com/moelhadary/Mine-Sweeper) : Capstone project building an autonomous landmine detection robot using ROS Noetic.
2. [Automatic Product categorization](https://github.com/sanskarsoni88/Auto-categorization-pipeline): Deployment and testing stage of product classification NLP pipeline.
3. [Agrobots Maize detection](https://github.com/sanskarsoni88/agrobots_my_contributions): Testing models such as Single Shot Detection (SSD), Faster R CNN, Masked R CNN, etc. to detect maize plants in real time with high accuracy and low latency.
4. [Beezy](https://github.com/sanskarsoni88/beezy): A smart monitoring and testing beehive, automating the manual calculation process of varroa mite infestation rates with a novel solution.
5. [Arduino Robot Muscle](https://github.com/sanskarsoni88/Arduino-Robot-Muscle): A 4 DOF collaborative robot (co-bot).
